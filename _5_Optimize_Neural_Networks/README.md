### 5.2 Training Neural Networks: Epochs, Batch Size, and Optimizers

Located in: `_05_2_Train_Network_Optimizers`

Master the critical parameters that control how neural networks learn:

- **Epochs:** Understanding the balance between underfitting and overfitting
- **Batch Size:** Optimizing the trade-off between speed, memory, and training stability
- **Optimizers:** Comparing SGD and Adam, and understanding when to use each
- **Practical Skills:** Experimenting with different configurations to find optimal settings
- **Real-World Applications:** See how these parameters impact fraud detection, recommendations, and churn prediction
