# Data Exploration and Preprocessing

This module focuses on the critical initial steps of any AI/ML project: understanding your data. Before building models, you must explore, clean, and prepare your data to ensure valid results.

## Modules

### 1. Understanding Data Types, Sources, and Loading Techniques
Located in: `_01_Understanding_Data_Types_Sources_and_Loading_Techniques`

Learn the foundational skills of:
- Identifying different data types (Numerical, Categorical, Text, etc.).
- Recognizing common data sources (Databases, CSV, JSON, etc.).
- Loading data efficiently using Pandas.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Pandas and Matplotlib
Located in: `_02_EDA_with_Pandas_and_Matplotlib`

Learn how to:
- Perform initial data inspection and understand data structure.
- Visualize data distributions and relationships using Matplotlib.
- Identify patterns, outliers, and correlations in the dataset.
- Apply EDA techniques to a real-world customer churn dataset.

### 3. Data Cleaning: Handling Missing Values, Outliers, and Inconsistencies
Located in: `_03_Data_Cleaning`

Learn how to:
- Identify and handle missing values.
- Detect and treat outliers.
- Correct data inconsistencies.

### 4. Feature Engineering and Selection for Model Performance
Located in: `_04_model_performance`

Learn how to:
- Engineer new features to improve model performance.
- Select the most relevant features for your models.
- Address the curse of dimensionality.
- Improve model interpretability.

### 5. Data Scaling, Normalization, and Encoding
Located in: `_05_Data_Scaling_Normalization_and_Encoding`

Learn how to:
- Scale numerical features to a common range.
- Normalize data to ensure consistent units.
- Encode categorical variables for model compatibility.
- Apply these techniques to a real-world fraud detection dataset.
