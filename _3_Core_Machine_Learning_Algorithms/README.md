# Core Machine Learning Algorithms
 
 Now that our data is clean and prepped, it's time to build the brains of our operation: the models. In this module, we'll explore the fundamental algorithms that power machine learning.

 ### 1. Supervised Learning Paradigms: Regression vs Classification
 Located in: `_01_Supervised_Learning_Paradigms_Regression_vs_Classification`
 
 Understand the two main pillars of supervised learning:
 - **Regression**: Predicting continuous values (like prices or temperatures).
 - **Classification**: Predicting categories (like spam vs. ham or churn vs. stay).
