# Introduction to Deep Learning with TensorFlow

Welcome to the Deep Learning module! Here, we move beyond traditional algorithms and explore the power of Neural Networks.

## Module Lessons

### 4.1 From Traditional ML to Deep Learning: The Concept of Neural Networks
Located in: `_04_1_The_Concept_of_Neural_Networks`

- Limitations: Why traditional algorithms struggle with complex data.
- The "Hidden" Secret: How neural networks discover their own features.
- Hierarchies: Moving from simple edges to complex objects.

### 4.2 The Perceptron Model: The "Atom" of AI
Located in: `_04_2_Perception_Model_Explained`

- Anatomy: Inputs, Weights, and the Bias.
- Learning Rule: How a machine improves through "trial and error."
- The XOR Wall: Understanding the limitations of simple models and why we need "Deep" networks.
